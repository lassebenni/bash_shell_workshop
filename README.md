  ####  Why should I care?

Bash is used in almost every facet of software development, from handling low level processes, automating simple jobs, creating complex networking operations, interacting with the filesystem on your computer, installing programs that install other programs that install other programs. The possibilities are endless. 

Most developers will encounter **bash** for the first time when they encounter Linux, where the command line is seen as far less scary than on Windows. For me, the first time I used bash was when I had to use a Linux laptop. Nowadays I use it as standard workflow for interacting with Docker, Linux machines and even my Windows machine. 

It can do impressive things like find a certain word in all the files on your computer, change 1000 of lines across multiple files, control another computer over the internet (or on your network). You can use it to quickly compare files, create or remove them.

You can do a lot of these things on Windows with Powershell, but I  personally find that it not as user-friendly as bash.

I see Bash as the glue that can intuitively paste different programs together to do what you want. It's ideal for scripting, which a nice way to say "hacking stuff together without consideration". But just like other programming languages, it is used to power most of the internet as we know it.

  > Question: "Is there any use for Bash scripting anymore?"
  >
  > microspino: "Bash is incredibly useful in system administration, web application deployment, data crunching, sutomated backups, even [getting-things-done day by day management](http://smarterware.org/1471/happy-birthday-todotxt-cli) just to name really few of them. I think It's too early for you to judge a "veteran IT soldier" like BASH."

  I salute you, Bash.

How to continue?

1. [Read the theory](theory.md)

    The theory behind using a shell, a sprinkle of UNIX and a something ominous called "terminal".

2. [Follow the tutorial in the jupyter notebook](bash_workshop.ipynb)

    The notebook contains step-by-step examples for learning bash commands on the computer.
